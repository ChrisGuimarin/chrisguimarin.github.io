I thrive at the intersection of imagination and pragmatism. Raised in Los Gatos, California, now rooted in New York City, I jump into the best-coast debate whenever it surfaces. As an Associate Director of Design for Battle.net at Blizzard Entertainment I lead designers who elevate the player-support journey, build internal tools that keep live services humming, and clear workflows for game developers. My superpower is converting abstract ideas into road-ready steps.

Outside games I co-founded Currant Productions and invest in shows like Real Women Have Curves. My years co-chairing Broadway Cares' NextGen Network proved the power of community; together we have raised more than three hundred fifty thousand dollars for artists in need. Whether sketching a feature flow or producing a concert, I love bringing creative visions to life and maximizing their impact.
