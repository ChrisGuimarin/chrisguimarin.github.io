    <h1>Culture Is What You Tolerate</h1>
    <time datetime="2026-01-31T00:00:00.000Z">January 30, 2026</time>
    
    <p>There's a line that keeps rattling around in my head: <em>your culture is defined by the worst behavior you tolerate.</em></p>
<p>It's usually aimed at organizations. The idea being that your team's values aren't what's printed on the wall. They're whatever you let slide. The standard you accept becomes the standard you have. Purposes are deduced from behavior, not from rhetoric or stated goals. What you <em>do</em> reveals what you actually value. Everything else is just a story you tell yourself.</p>
<p>But I keep thinking about this on a smaller scale. Personal scale.</p>
<p>What if your <em>life</em> is what you tolerate?</p>
<p>Not your goals. Not your aspirations. The minimum you're willing to accept from yourself on any given day.</p>
<p>Take taste. We talk about it like it's something you collect. Galleries visited, books read, influences absorbed. But taste is really just what you're willing to tolerate visually. The kerning you won't let slide. The color pairing that makes you wince. The misaligned element that gnaws at you until you fix it, even though the client would never notice.</p>
<p>Taste isn't your best work. It's your minimum acceptable work. The point below which you refuse to ship.</p>
<p>Two designers can have the same ceiling, the same theoretical capacity for excellence, but wildly different taste. The difference is the floor. One tolerates more. The other simply won't.</p>
<p>This applies beyond design. A person who can't get to the gym three times a week won't suddenly finish a marathon. An organization that can't run a meeting on time won't pull off a company-wide transformation. Did you close that ticket or let it roll into next week? Did you send the note or just think about sending it? Did you move your body or tell yourself you'd start Monday?</p>
<p>The floor matters more than the ceiling.</p>
<p>Most of the time, we tinker at the edges. We adjust the numbers, tweak the routine, buy a new app. But the high-leverage moments are rare. They're the ones that let you change the rules entirely, not just the parameters.</p>
<p>In organizations, this looks like layoffs, restructuring, a new vision, an existential threat acknowledged out loud. Blunt instruments that reset expectations.</p>
<p>In life, it's the moments that shake you awake. A death. A birth. A diagnosis. A job lost or a job that finally breaks you. The realization, sharp and sudden, that you aren't living the life you want to live.</p>
<p>These transitions are where new patterns form. The slate feels clean, even if it's painful. The old habits lose their grip because the context that held them in place is gone.</p>
<p>But here's what most people miss: the shock is just the opening. It's not the change itself.</p>
<p>After the dust settles, after the grief fades, after the novelty of the new job wears off, you fall back. That's the gravitational pull of who you've been. The shock only matters if you use that window to institute new standards. New expectations. A higher floor.</p>
<p>You have a window. Use it or lose it.</p>
<p>This is where the small things matter. Not because any single one is impressive, but because habits are the compound interest of self-improvement. Small deposits, made consistently, that stack on top of each other until the total dwarfs what any single contribution could have been.</p>
<p>What helps me: imagining myself as a new person. Not who I've been, but who I'm trying to become. What would that person's floor look like? What would they refuse to tolerate? What small things would they do without thinking?</p>
<p>Then I work backward. I don't try to convince the old version of myself to change. I just start acting like the new person would act. Small steps. Consistent steps. The kind that compound.</p>
<p>I've seen this play out beyond my own life. I've been a co-chair of the NextGen Advocates for Broadway Cares/Equity Fights AIDS for years. We've raised hundreds of thousands of dollars. I've spent the last two years thinking about how to step back. Not just handing off tasks, but making sure the good things we built into the culture persist. That the fundraising relationships carry forward. That the creative vision stays sharp. That the values we established become the values the group holds, not just the values I held.</p>
<p>Because things stop happening when the person driving them leaves or loses interest. Apple after Jobs didn't collapse. It fell back on its culture. The systems he built and the standards he embedded carried forward. Some things persisted. Others drifted. That's what happens when the floor rests on a single person.</p>
<p>The question isn't whether singular people can drive momentum. They obviously can. The question is whether you're building something that survives them. For groups, this means distributing the floor instead of concentrating it in a single point of failure. For individuals, it means building habits that don't depend on willpower or circumstance.</p>
<p>Lately I've been running a coding streak across personal projects. Some days I ship something real. A new feature. A fix that's been nagging at me for weeks. Most days I ship something small. A tweak. A cleanup. An incremental improvement nobody would notice but me.</p>
<p>But the streak holds. And the streak is the point.</p>
<p>Each day's work becomes the foundation for the next. The interest earns interest. The muscle builds on itself. It's not about being great every day. It's about showing up every day. And when something big does come along, the muscle is already there.</p>
<p>So, here's the question I keep coming back to: What's the worst behavior I'm tolerating from myself? What's the lowest-quality work I'm letting out the door? What small thing am I letting slide?</p>
<p>Because that's not the floor beneath my ambitions. That <em>is</em> the ambition. That's who I'm actually becoming.</p>
<p>The answer isn't to strive harder. It's to raise the floor.</p>
