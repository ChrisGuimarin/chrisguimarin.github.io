        <title>Culture Is What You Tolerate</title>

        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;There&#39;s a line that keeps rattling around in my head: &lt;em&gt;your culture is defined by the worst behavior you tolerate.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s usually aimed at organizations. The idea being that your team&#39;s values aren&#39;t what&#39;s printed on the wall. They&#39;re whatever you let slide. The standard you accept becomes the standard you have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I keep thinking about this on a smaller scale. Personal scale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What if your &lt;em&gt;life&lt;/em&gt; is what you tolerate?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not your goals. Not your aspirations. The minimum you&#39;re willing to accept from yourself on any given day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same principle shows up in taste.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We talk about taste like it&#39;s something you collect. Galleries visited, books read, influences absorbed. And that&#39;s part of it. But I think taste is really just what you&#39;re willing to tolerate visually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s the kerning you won&#39;t let slide. The color pairing that makes you wince. The misaligned element that gnaws at you until you fix it, even though the client would never notice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taste isn&#39;t your best work. It&#39;s your minimum acceptable work. It&#39;s the point below which you refuse to ship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two designers can have the same ceiling, the same theoretical capacity for excellence, but wildly different taste. The difference is the floor. One of them tolerates more. The other simply won&#39;t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think this connects to something I believe about creativity: that it&#39;s really just intellectual courage. The willingness to trust what&#39;s forming in your mind before you can fully explain it. Taste works the same way. It&#39;s the courage to say &amp;quot;no, this isn&#39;t good enough&amp;quot; before you can articulate exactly why. You feel it before you can defend it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&#39;s what connects organizations, design, and life: the small things aren&#39;t a distraction from the big things. The small things are how you build the muscle for the big things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An organization that can&#39;t run a meeting on time won&#39;t pull off a company-wide transformation. A designer who tolerates sloppy spacing on a button won&#39;t nail the brand system. A person who can&#39;t get to the gym three times a week won&#39;t suddenly show up for the hard stuff when it counts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Atomic Habits&lt;/em&gt; (on &lt;a href=&quot;https://chrisguimarin.com/shelf/&quot;&gt;my shelf&lt;/a&gt;), James Clear writes: &amp;quot;You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Thinking in Systems&lt;/em&gt; (also on &lt;a href=&quot;https://chrisguimarin.com/shelf/&quot;&gt;my shelf&lt;/a&gt;), Donella Meadows puts it another way: &amp;quot;Purposes are deduced from behavior, not from rhetoric or stated goals.&amp;quot; What you &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; reveals what you actually value. Everything else is just a story you tell yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The floor matters more than the ceiling. Your ambitions can be as high as you want, but your life will settle to whatever minimum you&#39;ve decided is acceptable. The culture you wanted gets replaced by the culture you allowed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We love the language of striving. The big push. The all-nighter. The heroic sprint to the finish line. And look, those moments matter sometimes. But they&#39;re not what moves the needle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What moves the needle is the boring stuff. The small things done effectively, consistently, without fanfare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did you close that ticket or let it roll into next week?
Did you send the note or just think about sending it?
Did you move your body or tell yourself you&#39;d start Monday?
Did you do the thing you promised yourself, the one nobody&#39;s tracking but you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it comes to developing and maintaining a new habit, frequency matters more than intensity. The small actions compound. Not because any single one of them is impressive, but because &amp;quot;habits are the compound interest of self-improvement.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You don&#39;t rise to the occasion. You fall to your training. And your training is just the accumulation of every small thing you did or didn&#39;t tolerate along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what about the singular visionaries?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You could point to Elon Musk or Steve Jobs. People who drove entire organizations forward through sheer force of will. They &lt;em&gt;were&lt;/em&gt; the momentum. They set the floor so high that everyone around them had no choice but to rise to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that works. Until it doesn&#39;t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Look at Apple after Jobs. The company didn&#39;t collapse. It fell back on its culture. For better or worse, the systems he built and the standards he embedded carried forward. Some things persisted. Others drifted. The taste remained high in certain areas and quietly eroded in others. That&#39;s what happens when the floor rests on a single person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve seen this up close. I&#39;ve been a co-chair of the NextGen Advocates for the NextGen Network at Broadway Cares/Equity Fights AIDS for years. We&#39;ve raised hundreds of thousands of dollars. I&#39;ve spent the last two years thinking about how I want to step back. Not just handing off tasks, but making sure the good things we built into the culture actually persist. That the fundraising relationships carry forward. That the creative vision stays sharp. That the values we established become the values the group holds, not just the values I held.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because here&#39;s the truth: things stop happening when the person driving them leaves or loses interest. If those things are critical to the work, the whole thing shifts. Sometimes it recovers. Sometimes it doesn&#39;t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question isn&#39;t whether singular people can drive momentum. They obviously can. The question is whether you&#39;re building something that survives them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This means knowing, in the moment, who and what is actually driving things forward. It means incentivizing those behaviors so they create their own momentum, independent of any one person. It means distributing the floor across the group instead of concentrating it in a single point of failure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&#39;s what makes a group resilient. Not the presence of a visionary, but the ability to adapt when the visionary moves on. Groups that can do this aren&#39;t dependent on singular people. They&#39;ve internalized the standard. The culture holds because it belongs to everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, though, you need to shock the system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Layoffs. Restructuring. Attrition. A new vision. An existential threat acknowledged out loud. These are blunt instruments, but they work. They reset expectations. They get people moving again when the floor has quietly sunk and everyone&#39;s pretending not to notice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meadows observed this pattern in systems more broadly: &amp;quot;Examples of bad human behavior are held up, magnified by the media, affirmed by the culture, as typical... And so expectations are lowered. The gap between desired behavior and actual behavior narrows.&amp;quot; The drift is slow. The recalibration often has to be sudden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But here&#39;s what most leaders miss: the shock is just the opening. It&#39;s not the change itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the dust settles, after the threat passes, everyone falls back into their old ways. That&#39;s the gravitational pull of culture. It wants to return to whatever it was before. The shock only matters if you use that moment of chaos to institute new standards and expectations. You have a window. Use it or lose it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And document it. Write it down. Not because documentation is exciting, but because new people become your biggest advocates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new person wants to know how things are done. They want to learn the dynamics, understand the expectations, find their footing. If you can get a new person aligned to the course direction from day one, they will help steer the ship even if you still have stragglers in the organization. The veterans might resist the new standard, but the newcomers will enforce it. They don&#39;t know any other way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is how you make change stick. Not by convincing everyone who&#39;s already there, but by setting the expectation for everyone who arrives next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lately I&#39;ve been running a coding streak across personal projects. Some days I ship something real. A new feature. A fix that&#39;s been nagging at me for weeks. Most days I ship something small. A tweak. A cleanup. An incremental improvement nobody would notice but me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the streak holds. And the streak is the point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is really about compounding. The same force that builds wealth in finance and skill in craft. Small deposits, made consistently, that stack on top of each other until the total dwarfs what any single contribution could have been.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Habits are the compound interest of self-improvement.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&#39;s how you move the floor up. Not through heroic effort, but through compounding momentum. Each day&#39;s work becomes the foundation for the next. The interest earns interest. The muscle builds on itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s not about being great every day. It&#39;s about showing up every day. And when something big does come along, the muscle is already there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So here&#39;s the question I keep coming back to: What&#39;s the worst behavior I&#39;m tolerating from myself? What&#39;s the lowest-quality work I&#39;m letting out the door? What small thing am I letting slide?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because that&#39;s not the floor beneath my ambitions. That &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; the ambition. That&#39;s who I&#39;m actually becoming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answer isn&#39;t to strive harder. It&#39;s to raise the floor.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Marks on Blank Pages</title>
        <link href="https://chrisguimarin.com/writing/marks-on-blank-pages/"/>
        <updated>2025-12-31T00:00:00Z</updated>
        <published>2025-12-31T00:00:00Z</published>
        <id>https://chrisguimarin.com/writing/marks-on-blank-pages/</id>
        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This year: a relaunched personal website, backed my first Broadway show, a promotion to Associate Director. Each one started as a mark on a blank page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some became real things. Some are still becoming. All of them taught me something about momentum: how one act of creation leads to the next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;I got promoted to Associate Director of Design at Blizzard.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leading design for Battle.net across accounts, checkout, game services, support, and developer platforms. Our team shipped meaningful updates to our paths to pay and play, plus hundreds of refinements that work so well players don&#39;t think about them. Which is the goal. Good design eases into the user&#39;s intent. That Edward Tufte line keeps proving itself: &amp;quot;Good design is a lot like clear thinking made visual.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Real Women Have Curves, the Musical opened on Broadway.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story mattered: working-class Latina immigrant women trying to achieve the American Dream, navigating dignity and belonging. Backing this show meant being part of something by helping creators realize their vision, watching performers make their Broadway debuts, and fulfilling my own dream of investing in my first show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will always remember the standing ovations night after night. The sound filling the room. The joy on faces. The energy in how people stood. I am so proud to have invested with family and friends and it all started with a friendship: Jack Noseworthy, the co-lead producer, who opened the door.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now when the cast album plays, those feelings comes back. &lt;em&gt;Entertainment Weekly&lt;/em&gt; ranked it #6 on their &amp;quot;Best of Broadway&amp;quot; Top Ten list, and people are still resonating with it. &lt;a href=&quot;https://ew.com/the-10-best-broadway-shows-of-2025-and-3-worst-11857578&quot;&gt;Read more in Entertainment Weekly →&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://music.apple.com/us/album/real-women-have-curves-the-musical-original-broadway/1813395457&quot;&gt;Listen on Apple Music →&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;NextGen Spotlight sold out and raised over $20,000 for Broadway Cares.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the chair, I helped raise more than $500,000 together for Broadway Cares through the NextGen Network over the past few years. It&#39;s time to pass the torch on leadership, but I&#39;ll be staying on to produce Spotlight going forward. The lesson keeps proving itself: we stand taller in ensemble. &lt;a href=&quot;https://playbill.com/article/this-years-nextgen-spotlight-raised-record-22-333-for-broadway-cares&quot;&gt;Read more in Playbill →&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;I taught myself to build for the web.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ChrisGuimarin.com is live. Learning git workflows, optimizing fonts, setting up RSS feeds. Not polished. But for the first time, architecting and structuring the site based on imagination, not constraints. No other builders dictating how their tool gets used, no product managers making decisions upstream. The site is my personal playground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;I started positioning for board advisory work.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still early. Taking courses, figuring out how design becomes strategic counsel. When design gets brought in early to something thorny, where users have to learn a new concept or navigate an unexpected flow, design can soften the experience. When design arrives late, it&#39;s handcuffed by prior decisions. Clarity often doesn&#39;t emerge until thinking becomes visual. I want to be the voice that asks &amp;quot;is this viable, trustworthy, and delightful?&amp;quot; before decisions lock. More to come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;I got back behind the camera.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taking more photos. Flowers, nature, life&#39;s moments. See below, a lily pad on a garden walk with Vincent and friends at the Madoo Conservancy. A sliver of time, captured.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://chrisguimarin.com/assets/images/madoo-lily-pad.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Lily pad and pink water lily at Madoo Conservancy&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Looking to 2026&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A backlog is waiting. First iOS app: a design quotation app for sharing favorites like that Edward Tufte line above. Not to make money, but to learn, to practice. Physical products to make. 2026 is the year talk becomes shipped work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Follow along at ChrisGuimarin.com.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Change isn&#39;t one big leap. It&#39;s the accumulation of showing up, the code commits, the creative attempts, the community work. One mark on a blank page, then another, then another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To more of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chris&lt;/p&gt;
